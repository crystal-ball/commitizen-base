## 2.0.0 Project Refresh ðŸŽ‰ (2019-10-09)

Re-release this package for using commitizen with ðŸ”® Projects. Having the
Commitizen adapter and Semantic Release configs rolled up into
`commit-semantics` doesn't provide much benefit and adds unnecessary overhead
for deps maintenance which is mostly what these two base packages require.

## 1.0.0 Project Release ðŸŽ‰ (2019-05-01)
